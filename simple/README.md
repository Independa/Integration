# Sample TV Webpage Display Content - Simple Webpage

This is a complete working example of a simple webpage without navigation 
that can be published on the Independa platform and displayed to TV users as
a community application. It is meant for developers who would like to create
or transform existing content into an application available on the Independa platform.

Exploring this code will show you how to stylize your content to fit Independa
environment. If your application requires more advanced navigation or integration,
see the example in the "full" directory.

## How To Use

This sample application showcases a facility that could be of interest to the users.
It contains contact information and a short description of services. It consists of
a single HTML page and accompanying css and a background image.

To see it in action, download all the files and open the index.html file in your browser.
To see what it would look like on TV, with the "Back" button automatically overlaid,
go to <http://demoapps.independa.com/homescreenapptester/> and enter the following
URL: http://demoapps.independa.com/tv_webpage/simple/index.html.

Feel free to use this code as a guide or a template.
