# Sample TV Webpage Display Content - Full Webpage

This is a complete working example of an application that can be published
on the Independa platform and displayed to TV users as a community application.
It is meant for developers who would like to create or transform existing content
into an application available on the Independa platform.

Exploring this code will show you how to:
 * stylize your content to fit Independa environment
 * respond to navigation by a remote control
 * open a new page
 * access the user information
 * close the application and return to the main menu

Feel free to use this code as a guide or a template.

## How To Use

This sample application displays cafe menu and specials, allowing simple navigation.
It consists of a few HTML pages and accompanying css and images.
To see it in action, download all the files and open the index.html file in your browser.
For testing purposes, the arrow keys on your keyboard will act as a remote control pad.

Explore the code to find out how the events can be programmed.
The key component allowing the application to work within the Independa platform
is the Javascript plugin, included with the following snippet:

`<script src="http://our.independa.com/plugin/plugin.js"></script>`

This gives your application access a global object called `independa` that allows you to
register callback functions. For complete function documentation, refer to our
[TV Webpage Display guide](http://training.independa.com/community/tv-digital-signage-guide/).

Feel free to include a reference to it in your code, as well as copy our independa.css
styles and button images.
