# Sample Community Application With Navigation

This is a complete working example of an application that can be published
on the Independa platform and displayed to TV users as a community application.
It is meant for developers who would like to create or transform existing content
into an application available on the Independa platform.

Feel free to use this code as a guide or a template.

This code will show you how to:
 * stylize your content to fit Independa environment
 * respond to navigation by a remote control
 * open a new page
 * get the user information
 * close the application and return to the main menu

For introduction to creating community applications and integrating it with Independa,
see: [Digital Signage guide](http://training.independa.com/community/tv-digital-signage-guide/).
